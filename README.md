# Medical Equipment Monitoring using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze medical equipment data
and predict abnormal or unhealthy operating conditions. The goal is to improve
equipment reliability, safety, and predictive maintenance using data-driven methods.

## Objectives
- Analyze medical equipment sensor data
- Train ML models to classify equipment health status
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations
- Demonstrate data analysis and AI application skills

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Prediction and recommendation generation

## Relevance to Internship
This project aligns with production DX and AI-based monitoring systems by
demonstrating data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving skills
applicable to real-world industrial and medical environments.
