# Equipment Health Monitoring using Machine Learning

## 1. Problem Statement
Manufacturing equipment failures cause unplanned downtime and reduce productivity.
Early detection of failure risk is essential for improving yield and operational efficiency.

## 2. Data Description
Sensor data including temperature, pressure, vibration, and operating hours was used
to represent equipment health conditions.

## 3. Methodology
Data analysis was performed to understand sensor behavior.
A Random Forest classifier was trained to predict equipment failure risk.

## 4. Results
The model demonstrated high recall for identifying risky equipment.
Vibration and operating hours were key contributors to failure prediction.

## 5. Improvement Proposal
Risk-based maintenance recommendations were generated to support preventive maintenance.
This reduces downtime and enhances production reliability.

## 6. Conclusion
The project demonstrates how AI-driven health monitoring can improve manufacturing productivity.
